# Roman-Arabic-Roman Converter

For this project, I created a software to convert roman numerals to arabic number and vice-versa. 

This is different from regular conversions because in this software the user can provide different symbols in place of the roman symbols, and the software needs to determine whether it is possible to convert an arabic number to roman (using only the new symbols) or to convert a roman numeral based on new symbols to arabic. 

For e.g., user can give input as QW where Q would corresponds to I of roman and W would corresponds to V of roman. So, it won't be possible to get any number larger than 8 (WQQQ) using these new symbols.
