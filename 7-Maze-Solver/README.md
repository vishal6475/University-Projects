# Maze-Solver  

This was a complicated project which involved reading a input text file defining a maze. The input file would contain numbers 0-3 describing the positions of walls in a cell of the maze grid. 

I created a class Maze which includes several methods to analyze and solve the maze. These methods finds out the gates, number of entry-exit paths in the maze, accessible areas, cul-de-sacs, and finally prints the total stats and creates a Latex file for the visual demonstration.
