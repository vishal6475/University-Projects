# Quickpic social media website  

This is a project to build a social media website like Facebook or Instagram. Users can create accounts on this site, update their profile details, follow or unfollow other people. 
They can make new posts, see posts of other people they are following, and like or comment on those posts.

## Steps for installation:  

### Create the initial folder to contain project:
1. Create a folder named 'Quickpic' on your laptop. This will be your project working directory.
2. Open command prompt terminal and go to the folder 'Quickpic'.

### Install the dependencies and start the backend system:  
3. Run the command `cd backend` to go to backend folder.
4. Run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt` to install all the dependencies for the backend system.
5. Run the command `python3 run.py` to start the backend system and API services.

### Install the dependencies and start the frontend application:  
6. Open a terminal and go to working directory 'Quickpic'.
7. Run the command `cd frontend` to go to frontend folder.
8. Run the command `python3 -m http.server` to start up an HTTP server which will run the 'index.html' file.

### Using the Quickpic website:  
9. Open the browser and open link http://localhost:8000 (or whatever link mentioned in terminal after doing step 8) to start browsing the Quickpic website.
10. Close all the opened terminals to shut down both the backend and frontend systems.

**Note:** I only built frontend application for this project and the backend system code was provided by the university.
