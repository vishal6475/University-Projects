# How to start the RESTFUL API server

## Steps to complete once

Only complete these steps once.

1. Within your `backend` folder in your project repo (i.e. the folder this `README.md` is in), run the command `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`. This only needs to be done once.

## Running the server

You complete this step every time you want to start the server.

2. Within your `backend` folder in your project repo (i.e. the folder this `README.md` is in), run the command `python3 run.py`. This will start the server and needs to be done every time.

**Note:** This backend system code was provided by the university and the frontend application was built by me.
