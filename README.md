# Projects done in university  

These are the major individual projects that I did in my masters degree. I have numbered them 1 to 11 based on the complexity and amount of work required by these projects.

## 1-BigBrain-Quiz-Hosting-Website  

This is a project for a quiz website like Kahoot. Users can register for admin accounts on this site, create game and questions for it. Admins are also able to start or stop any game. When an admin starts a game, they will be provided with a unique game session ID. Players are able to join any started game using the game session ID provided by an admin. Players don't need to login or register to join any game.

A video demo for this website can be seen at the below link:

## 2-QuickPic-Social-Media-Website  

For this project, I built a social media website QuickPic, like Facebook or Instagram. Users can create accounts on this site, update their profile details, follow or unfollow other people. They can make new posts, see posts of other people they are following, and post like or comment on those posts.

## 3-Client-Server-Chat-Networking-Program  

As part of this networking project, I made a client and a server and both are capable of sending messages between each other. The server should be started first and will keep record of all the users joined (clients) and the public messages. The server would also be rsponsible for authenticating the clients. Any user can login or register as a client. Users would be able to start private chats between each other, or start group chats with more than two people. 

## 4-REST-APIs-Flask  



## 5-Big-Data-Projects  

For Big Data, I developed 3 medium level projects.

## 6-Machine-Learning-Kaggle-Project  

For this Machine Learning projet, we built an algorithm to identify and categorize the input data consisting of question-answer pairs. The data for this competition contained several thousands question-answer pairs which were categorized into 30 different labels. As part of this competition, we were needed to analyze 30 labels and predict the correct question-answer categories for the test data.

## 7-Maze-Solver  

## 8-Neural-Networks-Cats-Classifier  

This project involves analyzing the input cat data and developing a neural network to classify cats into 8 different breeds.

## 9-Roman-Arabic-Roman

For this project, I created a software to convert roman numerals to arabic number and vice-versa. This is different from regular conversions because in this software the user can provide different symbols in place of the roman symbols, and the software needs to determine whether it is possible to convert an arabic number to roman (using only the new symbols) or to convert a roman numeral based on new symbols to arabic. For e.g., user can give input as QW where Q would corresponds to I of roman and W would corresponds to V of roman. So, it won't be possible to get any number larger than 8 (WQQQ) using these new symbols.

## 10-AI-Topic-Classifiers

These programs train the models on the training data which categorizes an article into 5 different topics: business, entertainment, politics, sport and tech. Then it runs the model on the test data to classify new articles into one of these 5 topics.

## 11-Data-Analysis-Program  

This program analyzes the data of different transportation routes (bus, train, ferry, etc.) of Sydney network through the input files routes.csv. It then cleanses and processes the data to find meaningful characteristics, and also plots the most important routes and their statistics on charts.
