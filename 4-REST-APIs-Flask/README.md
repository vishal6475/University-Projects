# REST-APIs-using-Python-Flask  

For this Python Flask project, I created several REST APIs to perform GET, PUT, POST, PATCH and DELETE operations. 

These APIs first connect to an existing API (which hosts TV actor's data) to fetch data and store it in a local database. 

Then the other API methods can retrieve, update and delete data from the local database. It also provides methods to generate different stats on the database data.
