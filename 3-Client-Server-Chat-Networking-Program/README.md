# Client-Server-Chat-Networking-Program  

As part of this networking project, I made a client and a server and both are capable of sending messages between each other. 

The server should be started first and will keep record of all the users joined (clients) and the public messages. The server would also be rsponsible for authenticating the clients. 

Any user can login or register as a client. Users would be able to start private chats between each other, or start group chats with more than two people.
