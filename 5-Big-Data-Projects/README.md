# Big-Data-Projects  

For Big Data, I developed 3 medium level projects. 

First project was a Hadoop MapReduce project to calculate the relative frequency of all word pairs in a text file, while the other two were SPARK projects. 

One SPARK project involved using GraphX Pregel operator to find if a triangle (cyclic path with three vertices) exists in a directed graph. 

For the other SPARK project, I used Google Dataproc to find similarity value between all record pairs in a text file whose similarity value is above the threshold.
